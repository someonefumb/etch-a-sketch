# Etch a Sketch
A website that lets you draw pixelated art.

## Reflection
Making a pixelated sketch page is pretty easy. The only hard part about this was the mouse events. I spent so much time trying to implementing the color system. Once I fixed one thing, something else wouldn't work. For example: I made it possible to drag to color the blocks, but then you couldn't click to color, so I had go back in and figure out how to fix it. Bugs after bugs, nightmare.
